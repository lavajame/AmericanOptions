American Put Option Price (1)
We need an equation for the American put option price, given the
boundary. Here it is:
Proposition 1. Let p (t, S) be the timet price of a European put option with
maturity T and strikeK. For the dividend-paying stockS(t), the American put
option priceP is given by
P(t, S)= p(t, S)+ rK
∫T
t
e−r(u−t)E
(
1{S(u)<S∗
T (u)}|S(t)= S
)
du
− (r − µ)
∫T
t
e−r(u−t)Et
(
1{S(u)<S∗
T (u)}S(u)|S(t)= S
)
du, (11)
for allS ≥ S∗
T (t).
The result is a generalization of Goetsche and Vellekoep (Math.
Finance, 2011) to cover the (practically important) caseµ ̸= r.
