Note: we don’t shift toB(T − t) and τ = T − t notation here, since the
problem is no longer time-stationary.
Above the exercise boundary and away from the dividend dates,t h e

Across each dividend date, the put option does not lose exercise
value (see below), wherefore we may impose the simple jump-type
continuity conditionP (ti−,S (ti−)) =P (ti+,S (ti+)) , i.e.
P (ti−,S )= P (ti+,S (1 − ci)) ,i =1 , 2,...,d .

American Put Option Price (1)
We need an equation for the American put option price, given the
boundary. Here it is:
Proposition 1. Let p (t, S) be the timet price of a European put option with
maturity T and strikeK. For the dividend-paying stockS(t), the American put
option priceP is given by
P(t, S)= p(t, S)+ rK

The result is a generalization of Goetsche and Vellekoep (Math.
Finance, 2011) to cover the (practically important) caseµ ̸= r.

American Put Option Price (3)
Proof of Proposition is instructional, so we can give a sketch:
Define H(t)= e−rtP(t, S(t)).W h e nS is below the boundary,
H(t)= e−rt(K − S(t)) and
dH(t)= −e−rtdS(t) − re−rt (K − S(t)) dt, S (t) <S ∗
T (t).
When S is above boundary,H is a martingale and (by BS equation)
dH(t)= σe−rtS(t)∂P
∂S dW(t)
Right AT the boundary, there would normally (by Tanaka’s rule) be a
local time contribution todH, but due to smooth pasting, it vanishes.
And crossing dividend dates add no terms todH.
Collecting, integrating to findH(T) − H(t) +f o r m i n gt i m et
expectations pops out the result.

Numerical Algorithm
The fixed point system can be executed using a variation of the
algorithm in ALO.
In particular, given Lemma 2’s “periodic” constraintS∗
T (ti−)=0 ,
i =1 ,...,d , it makes sense to break the problem intod sub-problems,
one per dividend period, and use ALO algorithm backwards to time 0
from timetd.
While Chebyshev spacing is still needed for the collocationscheme,
we generally do not need to be as careful with boundary
transformations fort<t d.
With d dividends, the effort of the scheme is (better than)d +1 times
that of the regular scheme. For single stocks,d is normally 4
times/year.

American Call Options (1)
Unlike the case for smooth dividends, there are no obvious parity
results to extract American call prices from puts.
American Calls, in fact, are very different from puts, and there are
situations where the exercise boundary is completely degenerate,
except for a few points.
In this case, the American option price integral changes fromb e i n ga n
integral in time along the boundary, to being (a convolution)o f
integrals in asset space.
For instance, in the case whereµ ≥ r, it is easy to see that the only
possible exercise dates are atti−, i =1 ,...,d , just before each
dividend.
