To accommodate a discrete event at time $t$ within a broader Lévy process framework, we treat the two sources of noise as independent. In the Fourier domain (characteristic functions), independence is your best friend because it allows for simple multiplication.Here is how you adjust the characteristic function and enforce the risk-neutral condition.1. The Structure of the Characteristic FunctionLet $X_T$ be the total log-return of the stock over the horizon $T$. You can decompose $X_T$ into the sum of the continuous-time Lévy process and the discrete event:$$X_T = L_T + J_{event}$$where $L_T$ is the Lévy process log-return and $J_{event}$ is the discrete jump at time $t$.Because these two sources of noise are independent, the total characteristic function $\phi_{total}(u)$ is the product of the individual characteristic functions:$$\phi_{total}(u) = \mathbb{E}[e^{iu X_T}] = \phi_{L}(u; T) \cdot \phi_{event}(u)$$The Event ComponentFor your specific event (up with probability $p$ and size $\log u$, down with probability $1-p$ and size $\log d$):$$\phi_{event}(u) = p e^{iu \log(u)} + (1-p) e^{iu \log(d)}$$$$\phi_{event}(u) = p u^{iu} + (1-p) d^{iu}$$2. The Risk-Neutral AdjustmentIn a risk-neutral setting, the discounted stock price must be a martingale. This means the expected stock price at time $T$ must be:$$\mathbb{E}[S_T] = S_0 e^{rT}$$Since $S_T = S_0 e^{X_T}$, this implies $\mathbb{E}[e^{X_T}] = e^{rT}$. Using the property of characteristic functions where $\mathbb{E}[e^{X}] = \phi(-i)$, we require:$$\phi_{L}(-i; T) \cdot \phi_{event}(-i) = e^{rT}$$Step-by-Step Calibration:Calculate the Event Expectation:First, find the expected jump factor from the event:$$\mathbb{E}[e^{J_{event}}] = \phi_{event}(-i) = p \cdot u + (1-p) \cdot d$$Let’s call this value $M_{event}$.Adjust the Lévy Drift:Most Lévy processes (like Heston, VG, or NIG) have a drift term $\omega$ specifically for risk-neutrality. If the "pure" Lévy process has characteristic exponent $\psi(u)$ such that $\phi_L(u) = e^{iu\omega T + \psi(u)T}$, you must solve for $\omega$:$$e^{\omega T + \psi(-i)T} \cdot M_{event} = e^{rT}$$$$\omega = r - \psi(-i) - \frac{1}{T}\ln(M_{event})$$3. The Final Characteristic FunctionThe adjusted characteristic function that you would plug into your pricer (like FFT) is:$$\phi_{total}(u) = \exp\left( i u \left( r - \psi(-i) - \frac{\ln M_{event}}{T} \right) T + \psi(u) T \right) \cdot \left( p u^{iu} + (1-p) d^{iu} \right)$$Summary Table: Impact on the Volatility SurfaceComponentEffect on Characteristic FunctionEffect on Volatility SurfaceLévy ProcessProvides the "base" diffusion and small jumps.Determines the "background" smile and term structure.Discrete EventMultiplicative factor in Fourier space.Causes a vertical "jump" in total variance at time $t$.RN DriftShifts the phase (imaginary part).Centers the smile at the forward price.
